{"name":"Bitcoin Checkout","tagline":"Open Source Bitcoin Checkout and Invoice System","body":"# Bitcoin Checkout and Invoice System\r\n\r\nThis is a Google App Engine demo project, showing a Bitcoin (or Litecoin or BlackCoin)\r\ncheckout and invoicing system with live quotes.\r\n\r\nIt produces nice-looking QR and BIP32-compliant payment links for the\r\namount, and has the customary time-limit, with animated count down,\r\nto indicate the exchange rate quote timeout.\r\n\r\nMost important of all, **real-time sensing of completed payment** is\r\ndemonstrated: Once the payer sends a transaction to the pubkey, the\r\ninvoice immediately clears and thanks the payer.\r\n\r\nOther features:\r\n\r\n- Support all fiat _currencies rates_ from Coinkite, plus all cryptos.\r\n- QR codes rendered directly into the page's HTML as SVG objects (faster, resolution independent).\r\n- Bootstrap v3 for responsive design: works on iPhones and desktops.\r\n- Demonstrates the Coinkite python API library (`ckapi`) on GAE.\r\n- Open source, so run with it!\r\n\r\n[Learn more about Coinkite's API here](https://docs.coinkite.com/)\r\nand visit the [Coinkite Main Site](https://coinkite.com/) to open your\r\naccount today!\r\n\r\n## The Demo\r\n\r\n<https://ck-rt-invoice.appspot.com>\r\n\r\nSee a live [Bitcoin Invoice demo here.](https://ck-rt-invoice.appspot.com/example.btc) \r\n(The data shown is placeholder, so don't try to pay it!)\r\n\r\n[Litecoin and Blackcoin examples](https://ck-rt-invoice.appspot.com) can be reached\r\nfrom the site home page.\r\n\r\n### Example Invoice\r\n\r\n![Example Invoice](screen-shots/bitcoin-invoice.png \"Example Bitcoin Invoice\")\r\n\r\n### Responsive Layout \r\n\r\n![iPhone Invoice](screen-shots/iphone-bitcoin-invoice.png)\r\n\r\n### Making a New Invoice\r\n\r\n![Making new invoices](screen-shots/making-invoices.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## How To Run Locally\r\n\r\nClone this repo:\r\n\r\n\tgit clone git@github.com:coinkite/coinkite-real-time-invoice.git\r\n\r\nThen update the submodules:\r\n\r\n\tgit submodule update\r\n\r\nGet an API key for your Coinkite account. It should have `recv`, `read` and `events`\r\npermissions and access to the related accounts.\r\nEdit `settings.py` to insert your API key for it to use.\r\n\r\nThen run Google AppEngine... (this can also be done via their GUI).\r\n\r\n\tdev_appserver.py app.yaml\r\n\topen http://localhost:8080\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nGo to `/make` to see a list of invoices and their status. You may also create new\r\ninvoices on that page, simply by specifying an amount and currency type.\r\n\r\nInvoices are presented at `/invoice/<token>` where token is a random\r\ncode.  This is the URL you would give out to your customers via\r\nemail or whatever.\r\n\r\n## Code Layout\r\n\r\n- `static/` Static assets: CSS and Javascript files.\r\n- `templates/` HTML templates (Jinja2) format\r\n- `app.yaml` AppEngine configuration\r\n- `index.yaml` GAE indexing\r\n- `lib/` Python modules, loaded as submodules with symlinks\r\n- `main.py` Mainline code.\r\n- `models.py` Database models (one -- an invoice)\r\n- `settings.py` Coinkite API keys.\r\n\r\n## Confirmations\r\n\r\nThis system works on zero-confirmation (in BTC), which isn't\r\nappropriate for real money. It should have different messaging for\r\nzero and one confirmations and fully-confirmed amounts. Of course,\r\nyou want to acknowledge the payment on zero confirmation, but you\r\nshouldn't ship any goods without at least one confirmation.\r\n\r\n\r\n## More about Coinkite\r\n\r\n_Join The Most Powerful Bitcoin Platform_\r\n\r\nCoinkite is the leading [bitcoin wallet](https://coinkite.com/faq/features) with\r\n[multi-signature](https://coinkite.com/faq/multisig),\r\n[bank-grade security](https://coinkite.com/faq/security),\r\n[developer's API](https://coinkite.com/faq/developers) and [hardcore privacy](https://coinkite.com/privacy).\r\n\r\n[Get Your Account Today!](https://coinkite.com/)\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-40834364-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
